<h3 id="g1docs-post-vs-submission">Post vs. Submission</h3>

<p>
    Snax workflow is based on two main concepts, Posts and Submissions.
    Before further reading, you should first get to know what they are and what's the main difference between them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Posts</strong> - you can think of them as standard Wordpres posts. Besides plugin related options, they work in pretty much the same way.<br />
    Example: User creates new "Open List". Other users may contribute to it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Submissions</strong> - children of a post. They are similar, in behaviour, to posts but cannot exist alone.<br />
    Example: User adds new "Submission" to an existing open list.
</p>


<h3>Add new post</h3>

<p>Here's how the standard submission process, from post creation to final approval, works:</p>
<ol>
    <li>User clicks the "+ Create" button.</li>
    <li>Choose one of available formats (e.g. Create open list).</li>
    <li>Upload images or add embeds.</li>
    <li>Fill required fields and submit a post for a review.</li>
    <li>Now, the submitted post is waiting for your approval in the <a href="#g1docs-review-submissions">review queue</a>.</li>
    <li>At this stage, only you (as administrator) and post author (as owner) have access to it.</li>
    <li>Until you publish this post, it won't be publicly accessible for all other visitors.</li>
    <li>To allow direct publishing, please read the <a href="#g1docs-users-permissions">Users permissions</a> section.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Add new submission</h3>

<p>Here are steps involved in new contribution process:</p>
<ol>
    <li>User visits one of the existing open lists.</li>
    <li>After all items, there's a new item form.</li>
    <li>User uploads an image or adds an embed.</li>
    <li>Fill required fields and submit an item for a review.</li>
    <li>Now, the submitted item is waiting for your approval in the <a href="#g1docs-review-submissions">review queue</a>.</li>
    <li>At this stage, only you (as administrator) and item author (as owner) have access to this item.</li>
    <li>Until you publish this item, it won't be publicly accessible for all other visitors.</li>
    <li>To allow direct publishing, please read the <a href="#g1docs-users-permissions">Users permissions</a> section.</li>
</ol>
