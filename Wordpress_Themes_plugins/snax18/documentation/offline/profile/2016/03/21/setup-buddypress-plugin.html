<h3>Start with BuddyPress</h3>

<p>
    If you are not already familar with the BuddyPress plugin, you probalby want to learn all about it before you start playing with the Snax.
    There are a lot of useful guides on the web but we recommend <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/buddypress-guide/" target="_blank">The Complete Guide to BuddyPress for WordPress</a>.
</p>

<h3>Start with Snax</h3>

<p>
    To start using Snax and BuddyPress you don't need to do any special configuration steps. Just install BuddyPress and Snax will do the rest.
    The order of plugin installation doesn't matter. You can have BuddyPress already installed or install it after Snax.
</p>

<h3>Turn on/off Snax components</h3>

<p>
    By default, Snax enables all its components (Posts, Submissions, Votes). Of course it always depends on you, what components you want to use.
    To change default configuration, please do as follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to the <strong>WP admin &rsaquo; Settings &rsaquo; BuddyPress</strong>.</li>
    <li>In the <strong>Components</strong> tab, you will find all Snax components (name with the "Snax" prefix).</li>
    <li>For example, if you don't like to use the <strong>Snax Submissions</strong> component, just uncheck it.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="g1docs-do-i-need-all-buddypress-components">Do I need to use all other BuddyPress components?</h3>

<p>
    No, you don't need to use any additional components delivered with the BuddyPress. BuddyPress requires two components:
    <strong>BuddyPress Core</strong> and <strong>Comunnity Members</strong> and that's all. All others are optional.
