<h2 id="g1docs-set-up-quizzes">Set up quizzes</h2>

<p>
    There are two types of quizzes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>frontend</strong> - behave like other Snax formats</li>
    <li><strong>backend</strong> - behave like any custom post type</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to enable frontend quizzes?</h3>

<p>
    As with other Snax formats, you need to activate quizzes (both Trivia and Personality) in <strong>WP admin panel &rsaquo; Settings &rsaquo; Snax &rsaquo; General &rsaquo; Active formats</strong> before your users will be able to use them.
</p>

<h3>How to enable backend quizzes?</h3>

<p>
    You don't need to activate backend quizzes. When Snax is activated the quizzes are accessible via <strong>WP admin panel &rsaquo; Quizzes</strong>.
