<h2 id="g1docs-review-submissions">Review new posts and submissions</h2>

    When user creates a new post/submission, new item is not published immediately.
    Lack of verification it is not a good idea and most likely you want to know what is added to your site.
    That's why before any new item will be accessible for your visitors, it's waiting for moderation in the review queue.
