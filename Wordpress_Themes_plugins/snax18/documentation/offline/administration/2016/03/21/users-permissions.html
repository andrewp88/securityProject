<h2 id="g1docs-users-permissions">Users permissions</h2>

<p>
    Snax permissions are based on the WordPress roles and capabilities system. Most of necessary configuration is done
    during plugin activation so, in most cases, you don't need to do anything more.
</p>

<h3>Roles and capabilities</h3>

<p>
    Snax provides only one <strong>Snax Author</strong> (snax_author) role and the following capabilites:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>snax_upload_files</strong> - allows users to upload files</li>
    <li><strong>snax_add_posts</strong> - allows users to create new posts</li>
    <li><strong>snax_add_items</strong> - allows users to create new submissions</li>
    <li><strong>snax_delete_items</strong> - allows users to delete their own submissions</li>
    <li><strong>snax_vote_posts</strong> - allows users to vote on posts</li>
    <li><strong>snax_vote_items</strong> - allow users to vote on submissions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Basic configuration</h3>

<p>
    By default, Wordpress assigns its default role (the <strong>Subsciber</strong> role) to all new users registered on your site.
    If you don't change that <a href="#g1docs-change-default-user-role">setting</a>, Snax during
    activation process will change it to the <strong>Snax Author</strong> role. From now, all new users will be able to use Snax.
    For old users, if you have any, you will need to assign the <strong>Snax Author</strong> role to them manually (or using some 3rd party plugin).
</p>
<p>
    Generally speaking, all your user needs to start using Snax is the <strong>Snax Author</strong> role assigned to him.
</p>

<h3 id="g1docs-change-default-user-role">How to change default user role (for all new users)?</h3>

<p>To change the role that will be assigned to all new users registered on your site, please follow these simple steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to the <strong>WP admin panel &rsaquo; Settings &rsaquo; General</strong></li>
    <li>Select the <strong>Snax Author</strong> option in the <strong>New User Default Role</strong> field.</li>
    <li>Save changes.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="g1docs-assign-new-role-to-existing-user">How to assign new role to existing user?</h3>

<p>To assign new role, and keep all current user roles assigned, please do as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Install and activate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/" target="_blank">Members</a> plugin.</li>
    <li>Go to the <strong>WP admin panel &rsaquo; Users</strong></li>
    <li>Choose a user and click it.</li>
    <li>Scroll down to the <strong>Roles</strong> section.</li>
    <li>Check the box right next to the role you want to add (<strong>Snax Author</strong> role).</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Update User</strong> button</li>
</ol>


<h3>Advanced permissions management</h3>

<p>
    If the basic configuration is not sufficent for your site, e.g. becuase you have already defined other users permissions,
    you can use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/" target="_blank">Members</a> plugin to add necessary capabilities
    to existing roles.
</p>

<p>
    Let's say your users (old and new) require to have the <strong>SPECIAL_ROLE</strong> role and you can't change this.
    It's not a problem, you can assign Snax capabilites to any role you want.
    To do this, using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/" target="_blank">Members</a> plugin, please follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Install and activate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/" target="_blank">Members</a> plugin.</li>
    <li>Go to the <strong>WP admin panel &rsaquo; Users &rsaquo; Roles</strong></li>
    <li>Click your <strong>SPECIAL_ROLE</strong> role (or any other role you want to assign Snax capabilites to).</li>
    <li>Check the box (in the "Grant" column) right beside capabilites with the <strong>snax_</strong> prefix (full list above).</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Update</strong> button</li>
</ol>
