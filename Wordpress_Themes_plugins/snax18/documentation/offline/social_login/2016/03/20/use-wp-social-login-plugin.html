<p>
    With the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-social-login/" target="_blank">WordPress Social Login</a> plugin, you give your visitors
    an ability to login with social networks like Facebook, Twitter and more.
    No more old fashioned registration form and confirmation emails!
    No one wants to create a new account just to check what your site has to offer. Don't make this mistake and don't try to change users habits.

<h3>Snax + WP Social Login</h3>

<p>
    Using WP Social Login as your Snax login/register service, your users <strong>DON'T NEED TO</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>create a new account</li>
    <li>fill out registration forms</li>
    <li>wait for confirmation emails</li>
    <li>remember another usernames and passwords</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="g1docs-is-wp-social-login-required">Can I use Snax without WP Social Login?</h3>

<p>
    Yes, of course you can use the Snax without any 3rd party login plugins. But believe us, you don't want to do that.
    Nowadays, for most users creation of a new account seems hard to overcome. If user needs to register when he only wants
    to check how a site works, it will probaly quickly leave it. And that's the last thing you want.
