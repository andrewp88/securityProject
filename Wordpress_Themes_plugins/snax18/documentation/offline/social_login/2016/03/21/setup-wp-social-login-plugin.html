    Social Login requires a little bit of effort on your part to have it up and running in your website.
    As a matter of control and security, Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc., will require you to apply for an application first.
    Generally speaking, registering a new application is <strong>free</strong> and only takes a <strong>few minutes</strong>.
