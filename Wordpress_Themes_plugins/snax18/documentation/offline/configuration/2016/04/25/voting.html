<h2 id="g1docs-voting">Voting</h2>

<p>
    Voting system allows users to upvote/downvote every post that was created using Snax uploader (List, Gallery, Story etc).
</p>

<h3>Disable voting</h3>

<p>
    To disable voting globally, please do as follows:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to the <strong>WP admin panel &rsaquo; Snax</strong>.</li>
    <li>Switch to the <strong>Voting</strong> section.</li>
    <li>Uncheck the <strong>Voting enabled?</strong> option.</li>
    <li>Save changes.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Allow users to vote on other post types</h3>

<p>
    To allow users to vote on a post that is not any of Snax formats, please do as follows:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to the <strong>WP admin panel &rsaquo; Snax</strong>.</li>
    <li>Switch to the <strong>Voting</strong> section.</li>
    <li>Make sure that the <strong>Voting enabled?</strong> option is checked.</li>
    <li>Check all post types that can be voted</li>
    <li>Save changes.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Fake votes</h3>

<p>
    New posts start with votes counter set to 0. It doesn't look good and it doesn't attract your visitors.
    The "Fake votes" feature will help you solve that problem.
</p>

<h4>Use auto-calculation</h4>
<p>
    Automatic votes calculation gets into account post publish date. At first votes counter won't be equal to value you set as <strong>Fake vote count base</strong> (see below) but will
    be only 10% of it. The counter will reach the final value after 30 days which makes it look more natural during post lifetime. To enable auto-calculation, please do as follows:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to the <strong>WP admin panel &rsaquo; Snax</strong>.</li>
    <li>Switch to the <strong>Voting</strong> section.</li>
    <li>Make sure that the <strong>Voting enabled?</strong> option is checked.</li>
    <li>Set the <strong>Fake vote count base</strong> value. Be aware that </li>
    <li>Save changes.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Set exact votes value per post</h4>

<p>
    If you prefer to set votes counter to an exact value, regardless of the "Fake vote count base" value, please do as follows:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to the <strong>WP admin panel &rsaquo; Posts</strong>.</li>
    <li>Open your target post to edit.</li>
    <li>Scroll down to the <strong>Fake votes</strong> metabox.</li>
    <li>Set the <strong>Fake vote count</strong> value.</li>
    <li>Update post.</li>
</ol>
