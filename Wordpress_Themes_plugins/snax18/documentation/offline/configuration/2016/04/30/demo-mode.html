<h2 id="g1docs-demo-mode">Demo Mode</h2>

<p>
    The demo mode is the fastest way to start playing with frontend submission. Thanks to it,
    you don't need to upload new images/embeds all the time you want to test submission process.
</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
    To enable demo mode, please do as follows:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to the <strong>WP admin panel &rsaquo; Snax</strong>.</li>
    <li>Switch to the <strong>Demo</strong> section.</li>
    <li>Check the <strong>Demo mode enabled?</strong> box.</li>
    <li>From the Media Library choose (or upload new ones) images that will be used as your demo images.</li>
    <li>Fill in embed URL and choose post image if you want to test embeds.</li>
    <li>Now, when you create a new post, demo data will show up under the upload image/embeb form.</li>

</ol>
