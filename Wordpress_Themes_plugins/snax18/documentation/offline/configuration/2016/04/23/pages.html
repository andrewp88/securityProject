<h2 id="g1docs-pages">Pages</h2>

<p>
    Snax requires only one custom page to work. It's the <strong>Frontend Submission</strong> page. It's a start point to create any new post (Open List, Embed etc.).
</p>

<p>
    Other pages are optional. These are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Terms and Conditions</strong> - frontend submission rules and privacy policy.</li>
    <li><strong>Report</strong> - page on which you can put some contact form to get feedback from users about all kind of abuses.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>
    The <strong>Frontend Submission</strong> page is created and assigned during plugin installation. Only optional pages have to be created manually.
    Please follow these simple steps to set them up:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to the <strong>WP admin panel &rsaquo; Pages &rsaquo; Add New</strong> and create a new page (e.g. Report).</li>
    <li>Fill its content (add a contact form, describe rules to follow etc).</li>
    <li>Publish page.</li>
    <li>Now, go to the <strong>WP admin panel &rsaquo; Snax</strong>.</li>
    <li>Switch to the <strong>Pages</strong> section.</li>
    <li>Assign your newly created page to the relevant field.</li>
    <li>Save changes.</li>
</ol>
